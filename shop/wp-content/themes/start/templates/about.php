      <h3>What we do</h3>
      <h6>The books are compilations that are typically created by the pulling together of several hands to make the whole. More like a montage, the creations are entire projects and can be likened to a child raised, loved, and owned by an entire village.</h6>
      <h6>The books bear a distinctive appearance: large, bold colour, high quality, and designed for aesthetic resonance. They make thoughtful gifts and unique keepsakes.</h6>
